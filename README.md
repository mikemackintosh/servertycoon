# Server Tycoon

A tycoon-style game where players manage a datacenter, including servers, networking equipment, and infrastructure. Build your datacenter empire by upgrading hardware and optimizing performance!

## Features

- Isometric 3D datacenter view
- Interactive server rack management
- Server hardware configuration
- Revenue generation based on server performance
- Upgrade paths for components

## Technologies

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- Vite for fast development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## Game Mechanics

- **Datacenter Management**: Place server racks in your datacenter grid.
- **Rack Management**: Configure each rack with different servers.
- **Server Configuration**: Customize server hardware like CPU, RAM, storage, and networking.
- **Revenue Generation**: Better servers generate more revenue over time.
- **Upgrades**: Invest in better components to increase performance and revenue.
